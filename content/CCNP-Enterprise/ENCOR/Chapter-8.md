###### 1) What does OSPF stand for and what is its primary function?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
OSPF stands for **Open Shortest Path First**. It is an open standard link-state routing protocol used for finding the best path between the source and the destination router using the shortest path first algorithm.

###### 2) What are the different types of OSPF packets?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
- **Hello packets**: These packets are sent periodically on all interfaces (including virtual links) in order to establish and maintain neighbor relationships.

- **Database description (DBD) Packets**: These packets are exchanged when an adjacency is being initialized.  They describe the contents of the link-state database.

- **Link-state request (LSR) packets**: After exchanging Database Description packets with a neighboring router, a router may find that parts of its link-state database are out-of-date. The Link State Request packet is used to request the pieces of the neighbor's database that are more up-to-date.

- **Link-state update (LSU) packets**: These packets are for database updates. This is an explicit LSA for a specific network link and normally is sent in direct response to an LSR.

- **Link-state acknowledgement (LSA) packets**: These packets are for flooding acknowledgments. These packets are sent in response to the flooding of LSAs, thus making flooding a reliable transport feature.

###### 3) Can you list the data contained in an Hello packet and that are used to negotiate neighbor relationships?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
- **Router ID (RID)** - A unique 32-bit ID within an OSPF domain used to build a topology.
- **Authentication options** - A field that allows secure communication between OSPF routers to prevent malicious activity. Options are:
    - none
    - clear text
    - Message Digest 5 (MD5) authentication.
- **Area ID** - The OSPF area that the OSPF interface belongs to.
- **Interface address mask** - The network mask for the primary IP address for the interface out which the hello is sent.
- **Interface priority** - The router interface priority for DR elections.
- **Hello interval** - The time span, in seconds, that a router sends out hello packets on the interface.
- **Dead interval** - The time span, in seconds, that a router waits to hear a hello from a neighbor router before it declares that router down.
- **Designated router** - The IP address of the DR.
- **backup designated router** - The IP address of the BDR.
- **Active neighbor** - The RIDs of each router from whom valid Hello packets have been seen recently on the network.  Recently means in the last RouterDeadInterval seconds.

###### 4) What is the significance of Designated Router (DR) in OSPF?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
The Designated Router (DR) minimizes the number of adjacencies by acting as a central point for exchanges of routing information between OSPF routers in the same broadcast network.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 5) How does the DR election works"
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
In the DR election process:
- the router with the **highest priority** is elected as the DR.
-  if there is a tie, then the router with the **highest RID** (Router ID)wins
    - RID is by default the highest IP address of a loopback interface
    - If there is no interface, then it is highest IP address of a physical interface

###### 6) what is the difference between an OSPF neighbor router and OSPF adjacent router?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
- **An OSPF neighbor router** is a router that shares a common OSPF-enabled network link. They are discovered OSPF hello packets. 
- **An OSPF adjacent router** is an OSPF neighbor that shares a synchronized OSPF database between the two neighbors.
Two routers can be neighbors without neccessary becoming adjacents. For example, in a broadcast networks all router can only be adjacents to the DR and BDR.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 7) For OSPF neigbor routers to become adjacent, The neigbor relationship has to evolve through different states. What are those OSPF neighbor states?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
- **Down** - This is the initial state of a neighbor relationship. It indicates that the router has not received any OSPF hello packets.
- **Attempt** - This state is relevant to NBMA networks that do not support broadcast and require explicit neighbor configuration. This state indicates that no information has been received recently, but the router is still attempting communication.
- **Init** - This state indicates that a hello packet has been received from another router, but bidirectional communication has not been established.
- **2-Way** - Bidirectional communication has been established. If a DR or BDR is needed, the election occurs during this state.
- **ExStart** - This is the first state in forming an adjacency. Routers identify which router will be the primary or secondary for the LSDB synchronization.
- **Exchange** - During this state, routers are exchanging link states headers by using DBD packets.
- **Loading** - LSR packets are sent to the neighbor, asking for the more recent LSAs that have been discovered (but not received) in the Exchange state.
- **Full** - Neighboring routers are fully adjacent.

###### 8) What are OSPF interface roles?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
- **DR** - In this state, the router is the DR on the attached network and will establish adjacencies with the other routers on the multi-access network.
- **BDR** - In this state, the router is the BDR on the attached network, and will establish adjacencies with the other routers on the multi-access network.
- **DROTHER** - In this state, the router is neither the DR nor the BDR on the attached network. It will form adjacencies only with the DR and BDR, although it will track all neighbors on the network.
- **Loopback** - In this state, the interface is looped back via software or hardware. Although packets cannot transit an interface in this state, the interface address is still advertised in Router LSAs so that test packets can find their way to the interface.
- **Point-to-point** - This state is applicable only to interfaces connected to point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and virtual link network types. When an interface transitions to this state, it is fully functional. It will begin sending Hello packets every Hello Interval and will attempt to establish an adjacency with the neighbor at the other end of the link.
- **Waiting** - This state is applicable only to interfaces connected to broadcast and NBMA network types. When an interface transitions to this state, it will begin sending and receiving Hello packets and will set the wait timer. The router will attempt to identify the networkâ€™s DR and BDR while in this state.
- **Down** - This is the initial state.

###### 9) What is a passive interface in OSPF?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
Making the network interface passive still adds the network segment into the LSDB but prohibits the interface from forming OSPF adjacencies
{{% /expand %}}

###### 10) What happens when OSPF priority is setup to zero?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
When OSPF priority is setup to zero on a router, that router will not be able to enter into DR/BDR election.
To configure interface priority, please use the following commands:
- `interface GigabitEthernet 0/1`
- `ip ospf priority 0`
{{% /expand %}}

###### 11) What are OSPF multicast addresses
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
- **224.0.0.5** - this is an *All OSPF routers*  address is used to send Hello packets to all OSPF routers on a network segment. 
- **224.0.0.6** - this is an *All designated routers* address is used to send OSPF routing information to designated routers on a network segment.

###### 12) What is an OSPF area?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
An OSPF area is a logical grouping of routers or, more specifically, a logical grouping of router interfaces.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 13) Why would you have an OSPF achitecture with multiple areas?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
The primary purpose of OSPF areas is to optimize the OSPF routing process and to scale large networks by:
- minimizing the frequency of routing table calculations 
- minimizing the size of LSDB table
- making route summarization possible.

###### 6) How does OSPF calculate the cost of a route?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
OSPF calculates the cost of a route based on the inverse of the bandwidth of the link. Higher bandwidth implies a lower cost.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 7) Describe OSPF's LSA types briefly.
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
LSA types in OSPF include:
- Type 1: Router LSAs
- Type 2: Network LSAs
- Type 3: Summary LSAs (route information between areas)
- Type 4: Summary ASBR LSAs (locations of ASBRs)
- Type 5: External LSAs (routes to networks outside the OSPF domain)
- Type 7: NSSA External LSAs (used in Not So Stubby Areas)
{{% /expand %}}

###### 8) What is an OSPF backbone area?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
The OSPF backbone area (Area 0) is the core of an OSPF network to which all other areas must connect, either directly or through virtual links.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 9) Explain the process of route summarization in OSPF.
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
Route summarization in OSPF is done at area border routers (ABRs), where routes from one area are summarized before being advertised into another area to reduce the size of routing tables.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 10) What is the function of a virtual link in OSPF?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
A virtual link in OSPF is used to connect an area that does not have a direct physical connection to the backbone area (Area 0) through another area.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 11) Discuss the role of an Area Border Router (ABR) in OSPF.
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
An ABR connects two or more OSPF areas, is responsible for routing traffic between them, and performs route summarization.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 12) What is the difference between Intra-Area, Inter-Area, and External Routes in OSPF?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
Intra-Area routes are within the same area, Inter-Area routes are between different areas, and External routes originate from outside the OSPF autonomous system.
{{% /expand %}}`

###### 13) How do OSPF metrics affect traffic engineering?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
OSPF metrics can be manipulated to influence route selection, allowing network engineers to direct traffic through preferred paths based on bandwidth, load, or other criteria.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 14) Explain OSPF's Stub Area and its benefits.
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
A stub area is an area that does not receive route advertisements external to the OSPF domain. It reduces the size of the routing table and limits the types of LSAs allowed into the area.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 15) How does OSPF handle loop prevention?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
OSPF uses the Shortest Path First algorithm and LSA sequence numbers to ensure there are no routing loops.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 16) What steps would you take to configure OSPF on a new router?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
To configure OSPF, define the OSPF process, assign interfaces to OSPF areas, set area types if necessary, and configure authentication.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 17) How can OSPF be optimized for large-scale networks?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
OSPF can be optimized by properly designing network areas, using route summarization, and tuning OSPF parameters like hello and dead intervals.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 18) Describe how OSPF interacts with other routing protocols.
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
OSPF can interact with other routing protocols via route redistribution. Proper filtering and metric adjustments are necessary to manage traffic flow and prevent routing loops.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 19) What would cause an OSPF adjacency to fail?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
OSPF adjacency might fail due to mismatched subnet masks, area IDs, authentication settings, MTU sizes, or Hello/Dead timers between neighbors.
{{% /expand %}}

###### 20) How does OSPF ensure data security?
{{% expand title="Answer" %}}
OSPF supports message digest authentication (MD5) to secure routing updates.
